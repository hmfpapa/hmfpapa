<h1> ✨ Hi, I'm Hannah ✨ </H1>



<H2>💻 About Me</h2>
I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Nashville Software School and am expecting to complete the program in May. Following years in Management and Events, I am excited to dive into a career in Technology. I am eager to apply my skills in planning, problem-solving, and communication to Software Development and to focus on growth as a lifelong learner.

<H2>⚒️Work in Progress</H2>
<h4>I'm always striving to develop and practice my skills. This is my current extracurricular project</h4>
My classmate and I are collaborating on a website called ClassApp, which aims to help our cohort stay organized and connected. Whether we're working on class projects, researching job opportunities, or simply hanging out, ClassApp provides us with a comprehensive solution for our scheduling and planning needs. With ClassApp, organizing events is effortless; you can easily create, modify, or cancel them. Do you want to schedule a "coffee and coding" meetup, or plan a movie night or happy hour? No worries, ClassApp has got us covered. Additionally, classmates can indicate their attendance for each event, allowing our peers to know who's coming and who's not. For security reasons, only our cohort 61 peers will have access to the site using a unique access code, providing a secure and supportive environment for everyone.
