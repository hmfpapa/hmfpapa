<h1> ✨ Hi, I'm Hannah ✨ </H1>



<H2>💻 About Me</h2>
I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Nashville Software School and am expecting to complete the program in May. Following years in Management and Events, I am excited to dive into a career in Technology. I am eager to apply my skills in planning, problem-solving, and communication to Software Development and to focus on growth as a lifelong learner.

<H2>⚒️Work in Progress</H2>
<h4>I'm always striving to develop and practice my skills and am always open to collaborate!</h4>
I've just completed my <a href="https://github.com/jennykayekitchen/ClassApp">ClassApp</a> collaborative project with an NSS classmate.
<br>
As I approach the end of my time at NSS, I'm brainstorming for my final capstone and pursuing my next chapter.
